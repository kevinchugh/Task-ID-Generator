Task-ID-Generator
=================

A canonical Task ID generator for Trello, Asana, and other web based task management platforms.

Task managers like Asana and Trello do not automatically generate visible canonical task IDs. Task IDs are essential for conversations about work.

For example, this is a typical team conversation without a canonical ID:

Developer A: "Hey what's going on with Task 3?"
Developer B: "Oh, that's done."
Developer A: "Ok, I'll mark it done."
Developer B: "Great."
Developer A: "Now lets talk about Task 3."
Developer B: "What do you mean, we just talked about Task 3, it's done."
Developer A: "I'm looking at Task 3 right now, it's open."
Developer B: "Oh, stupid task manager moved Task 4 to Task 3 when you closed it."
Developer A: "I'm not 100% in love with your tone."

Here's a conversation with a canonical ID:

Developer A: "Hey how is task 322-ACE coming along?"
Developer B: "Great, but we should ship it with 321-DEE, don't you think?"
Developer A: "Yes."
Developer B: "This has been a pleasant interaction regarding our work."
Develoepr A: "I agree.  It's pleasant to have canonical task IDs."
